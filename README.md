# HUNGER

## Project Overview
Hunger is a 3D first-person narrative survival game developed in Unity. The player must survive the winter months (November to February) while managing systemic sacrifices across
three hidden values: Family, Home, and Self. The experience focuses on environmental storytelling, psychological pressure, and cyclical survival.

The player lives on a small farm with their family and a starving creature named Don, who makes vague requests every morning. Each day, the player must choose an object to give up in order
to feed Don, unknowingly sacrificing aspects of their home, family, or self. These systems degrade overtime and are reflected through environmental changes, character behavior, and player condition.

The core experience centers on player choice without a clear path, encouraging uncomfortable trade-offs rather than "correct" choices. Endings are determined by which system
collapses first, or by surviving until spring with the lasting consequences.
