# HUNGER

## Project Overview
Hunger is a 3D first-person narrative survival game developed in Unity. The player must survive the winter months (November to February) while managing systemic sacrifices across
three hidden values: Family, Home, and Self. The experience focuses on environmental storytelling, psychological pressure, and cyclical survival.

The player lives on a small farm with their family and a starving creature named Don, who makes vague requests every morning. Each day, the player must choose an object to give up in order
to feed Don, unknowingly sacrificing aspects of their home, family, or self. These systems degrade overtime and are reflected through environmental changes, character behavior, and player condition.

The core experience centers on player choice without a clear path, encouraging uncomfortable trade-offs rather than "correct" choices. Endings are determined by which system
collapses first, or by surviving until spring with the lasting consequences.

## MVP Development
For the MVP of Hunger, I focused on implementing the core gameplay loop and foundational systems that define the game’s central experience: sacrifice as survival.
The MVP consists of a playable three-day winter cycle that demonstrates a daily loop. Each day begins with an abstract request generated by the creature, Don (e.g., “Warmth” or “Comfort”). The player can explore a small 3D farmhouse environment and discover an array of interactable items. Once discovered, these items become available for sacrifice.
Each item is implicitly tied to one of three hidden categories: Home, Self, or Family. When the player sacrifices an item, the corresponding category value decreases. These values are not shown directly to the player but function as underlying survival systems through world feedback (e.g., lighting changes). If any category reaches zero, the player loses. If the player survives all three days, they win the prototype scenario.

The MVP includes:
- A functional day cycle system
- Randomized request generation
- Item discovery and sacrifice mechanics
- A stat reduction and fail-state system
- Basic win/lose conditions
- Core player controls and interaction logic
  
Rather than building full narrative content or multiple months of gameplay, the MVP prioritizes validating the central mechanic: making meaningful sacrifices under discovered resources. The prototype establishes a scalable system that can be expanded with more in-depth environmental feedback, narrative consequences, and additional content in future development phases.

## MVP Feedback
During early testing of the MVP, several areas for improvement were identified.
One common piece of feedback was that the day cycle didn't feel structured. Testers were unsure when a day ended and when a new one began. In response, I refined the day progression system to automatically advance after a sacrifice and ensured that each new day generates a clear request at the start. This helped reinforce the intended gameplay loop.
Another point of feedback was that the stakes of sacrificing items were not immediately obvious. Because the Home, Self, and Family categories are hidden systems, some testers did not initially recognize how their choices affected survival. To address this, I clarified the consequences through stronger feedback via lighting changes tied to the stat system (as a full narrative tree/textured models aren't part of the MVP), reinforcing the cause-and-effect relationship between sacrifice and survival. Essentially, the categories affected the brightness/dimness and warmth of the scene. If the player sacrificed items in a more balanced way then the lighting remained natural. However, if their sacrifices skewed to one cateogry, they saw the impacts on the world around them.
Additionally, early testers attempted to sacrifice items that had not been discovered or expected more item variety per day. Based on this feedback, I gave the players numerous available items they could discover and based on the request they chose which item they felt most "drawn" to. This simplified the system and strengthened the tension of choice, better highlighting the game’s central theme.
These iterations improved clarity, strengthened the core loop, and ensured the MVP better communicates the intended emotional and mechanical experience.
